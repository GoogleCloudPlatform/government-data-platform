# Government Data Platform (GDP) foundations

Building GDP starts with the construction of the infrastructure where the platform will be sitting. That's what this document is all about. It details the process of deploying GDP's foundation.

> Before proceding with the steps described here, please, make sure to read through and comply with what is described in the [**pre-requisites documentation**](../docs/gdp-prerequisites.md).

Before deploying GDP's foundation though, it is important to acknowledge important aspects related to the way resources are deployed. Security associated with flexibility are aspects we've taken from scratch to build it out. 

### Roles

We assign roles on resources at the project level, granting the appropriate roles via groups (humans) and service accounts (services and applications) according to best practices.

### Service accounts

Service account creation follows the least privilege principle, performing a single task that requires access to a defined set of resources. The table below shows a high-level overview of roles for each service account on each data layer, using `READ` or `WRITE` access patterns for simplicity. For detailed roles please refer to the code.

|Service Account|Drop off|DWH Landing|DWH Curated|DWH Confidential|
|-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|`drop-sa`|`WRITE`|-|-|-|
|`load-sa`|`READ`|`READ`/`WRITE`|-|-|
|`transformation-sa`|-|`READ`/`WRITE`|`READ`/`WRITE`|`READ`/`WRITE`|
|`orchestration-sa`|-|-|-|-|

A full reference of IAM roles managed by the Government Data Platform [is available here](./IAM.md).

Using service account keys within a data pipeline exposes several security risks deriving from a credentials leak. This blueprint shows how to leverage impersonation to avoid the need of creating keys.

### Resource naming conventions

Resources follow the naming convention described below.

- `prefix-layer` for projects
- `prefix-layer-prduct` for resources
- `prefix-layer[2]-gcp-product[2]-counter` for services and service accounts

# How to deploy

The steps below highlight what it takes to deploy GDP's infrastructure. Follow them carefully to get the deployment done.

> Before proceeding with those steps, please, **[make sure to double-check the prerequisites](../docs/gdp-prerequisites.md)** needed for the scripts to run.

### 1. Clone the original repository

The very first step to getting GDP deployed is cloning the this repository to your own organization. From there, everything can get started.

### 2. Variable configuration

To share code across environments, configure each environment directory (dev, qa, prod) to correspond to a [Terraform workspace](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state/workspaces), deploying a specific version of the service to each environment. Workspaces enable the deployment of specific service versions while isolating environment-specific resources.

If no Terraform workspace is explicitly created, the default workspace will be used, and the base configuration will fall back to config/default. Otherwise, the configuration will be taken from config/$terraform.workspace.

Use the example files [sample-configs/](/config/sample-configs/example.yml) as templates and update them to match the desired configuration.


#### 2.1 Environment variables

For each environment, you need config files into respective directory ./config/[default,dev, qa, prod].yml. This file defines your configuration settings for all resources.

### 3. Store Terraform state in a Cloud Storage bucket 

By default, Terraform stores state locally in a file named terraform.tfstate. This default configuration can make Terraform usage difficult for teams when multiple users run Terraform at the same time and each machine has its own understanding of the current infrastructure.
To help you avoid such issues, you need to configure a remote state that points to a Cloud Storage bucket. Remote state is a feature of [Terraform backends](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/backend/configuration).

Ensure that you configure the backend or use [Partial configuration](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/backend#partial-configuration). To do this create a file on `./config/backend.conf`

```
bucket = "your-bucket" 
key    = "your-state.tfstate"
region = "us-central1"
```

### 4. API`s and Workflows configs

See [Workflow Configuration](../docs/gdp-workflow-config.md)

### 4. Prepare the ingestion file to be precessed

gsutil -m cp endpointslambda gs://${BUCKET}

- Edit [sample.csv](./config/api-connector/sample.csv) with the appropriate API call parameters.
- Edit [config.json](./config/api-connector/config.json) with the appropriate API call workflows.


### 4. Run the project factory 
Once the configuration is complete, run the project factory:

#### Initialize Terraform

```
terraform init -reconfigure
```
This command initializes Terraform in the current directory, configuring the backend and necessary modules. The -reconfigure flag forces a reconfiguration of Terraform in case there are changes in the configuration.

#### Select or create a Workspace (optional)

```
terraform workspace select <Workspace> || terraform workspace new <Workspace>
```

This command attempts to select the specified workspace. If the workspace does not exist, it creates a new one. Replace placeholder with the name of the desired workspace (e.g., dev, qa, prod).

#### Plan and Apply the execution plan

```
terraform plan -out=tfplanfile
terraform apply tfplanfile
```

This command generates an execution plan and saves it to the file tfplanfile. If you are using a non-default workspace, add the -var-file=Workspace.tfvars option to specify the variables for that workspace. For example:


### 5. How to use this blueprint from Terraform

While this blueprint can be used as a standalone deployment, it can also be called directly as a Terraform module by providing the values of the variables as shown below:

```hcl
module "data-platform" {
  source              = "./fabric/blueprints/data-solutions/data-platform-foundations"
  billing_account_id  = var.billing_account_id
  folder_id           = var.folder_id
  organization_domain = "example.com"
  prefix              = "myprefix"
}
```

### 6. Data Catalog

[Data Catalog](https://cloud.google.com/data-catalog) helps you to document your data entry at scale. Data Catalog relies on [tags](https://cloud.google.com/data-catalog/docs/tags-and-tag-templates#tags) and [tag templates](https://cloud.google.com/data-catalog/docs/tags-and-tag-templates#tag-templates) to manage metadata for all data entries in a unified and centralized service. To implement [column-level security](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/column-level-security-intro) on BigQuery, we suggest using `Tags` and `Tag templates`.

The default configuration will implement 3 tags:

- `3_Confidential`: policy tag for columns that include very sensitive information, such as credit card numbers.
- `2_Private`: policy tag for columns that include sensitive personal identifiable information (PII) information, such as a person's first name.
- `1_Sensitive`: policy tag for columns that include data that cannot be made public, such as the credit limit.

Anything that is not tagged is available to all users who have access to the data warehouse.

For the purpose of the blueprint, no group has access to tagged data. You can configure your tags and roles associated by configuring the `data_catalog_tags` variable. We suggest using the "[Best practices for using policy tags in BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/best-practices-policy-tags)" article as a guide to designing your tags' structure and access pattern.

# Optional configuration

### Encryption (optional)

We suggest a centralized approach to key management, where Organization Security is the only team that can access encryption material, and keyrings and keys are managed in a project external to the Government Data Platform.

To configure the use of [Cloud KMS](https://cloud.google.com/security/products/security-key-management) on resources, you have to specify the key id on the `encryption-keys` variable. Key locations should match resource locations. Example:

```
encryption-keys:
  bq: "KEY_URL_MULTIREGIONAL"
  composer: "KEY_URL_REGIONAL"
  dataflow: "KEY_URL_REGIONAL"
  storage:  "KEY_URL_MULTIREGIONAL"
  pubsub: "KEY_URL_MULTIREGIONAL"
```

This step is optional and depends on customer policies and security best practices.

### Data Anonymization (optional)

We suggest using Cloud Data Loss Prevention to identify/mask/tokenize your confidential data.

While implementing a Data Loss Prevention strategy is out of scope for this blueprint, we enable the service in two different projects so that [Cloud Data Loss Prevention templates](https://cloud.google.com/dlp/docs/concepts-templates) can be configured in one of two ways:

- during the ingestion phase, from Dataflow
- during the transformation phase, from [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/scan-with-dlp) or [Cloud Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/running-automated-dataflow-pipeline-de-identify-pii-dataset)

Cloud Data Loss Prevention resources and templates should be stored in the security project:

![Centralized Cloud Data Loss Prevention high-level diagram](./images/dlp_diagram.png "Centralized Cloud Data Loss Prevention high-level diagram")

You can find more details and best practices on using DLP to De-identification and re-identification of PII in large-scale datasets in the [GCP documentation](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/de-identification-re-identification-pii-using-cloud-dlp).

# Customizations (optional)

### Create Cloud Key Management keys as part of the Government Data Platform

To create Cloud Key Management keys in the Government Data Platform you can uncomment the Cloud Key Management resources configured in the [`07-common.tf`](./06-common.tf) file and update Cloud Key Management keys pointers on `local.service_encryption_keys.*` to the local resource created.

### Assign roles at BQ Dataset level

To handle multiple groups of `data-analysts` accessing the same Data Warehouse layer projects but only to the dataset belonging to a specific group, you may want to assign roles at BigQuery dataset level instead of at the project level.
To do this, you need to remove IAM binging at the project level for the `data-analysts` group and give roles at BigQuery dataset level using the `iam` variable on `bigquery-dataset` modules.

### Demo pipeline

The application layer is out of the scope of this script. For a demo purpose only, several Cloud Composer DAGs are provided. Demos will import data from the `drop off` area to the `Data Warehouse `Confidential` dataset using different features.

You can find examples in the `[demo](./demo)` folder.
